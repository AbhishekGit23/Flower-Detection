# Flower-Detection
In this project, I have tried to create a flower direction algorithm using deep learning I have taken the data set from Kaggle. This project has been developed to detect weather particular images at a flower or not.This can be further utilised in the big applications like flower captioning in which the customer can click the image of the flower and the customer will get the information about the flow.

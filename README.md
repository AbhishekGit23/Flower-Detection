# Flower-Detection
In this project, I have tried to create a flower direction algorithm using deep learning I have taken the data set from Kaggle. This project has been developed to detect weather particular images at a flower or not.This can be further utilised in the big applications like flower captioning in which the customer can click the image of the flower and the customer will get the information about the flow.

## About Dataset
### Context
This dataset contains 4242 images of flowers.
The data collection is based on the data flicr, google images, yandex images.
You can use this datastet to recognize plants from the photo.

### Content
The pictures are divided into five classes: chamomile, tulip, rose, sunflower, dandelion.
For each class there are about 800 photos. Photos are not high resolution, about 320x240 pixels. Photos are not reduced to a single size, they have different proportions!

So, this is the project which I have developed. Hope you liked it.
